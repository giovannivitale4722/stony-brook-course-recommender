# 🧠 CSE Course Recommender - AI-Powered Course Discovery

An intelligent course recommendation system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to help students find relevant Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) courses at Stony Brook University based on their interests and learning goals.

## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Powered Search**: Uses state-of-the-art sentence transformers to understand the semantic meaning of your queries
- **Semantic Similarity**: Goes beyond keyword matching to find courses that are conceptually related to your interests
- **Smart Recommendations**: Ranks courses by relevance using cosine similarity scores
- **Beautiful Web Interface**: Modern, responsive design with intuitive search and results display
- **Course Discovery**: Find courses similar to ones you already know and love
- **Real-time Search**: Instant results as you type your interests

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Step 1: Data Collection
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts course information (code, title, credits, description) from Stony Brook University's course catalog
- **Data Cleaning**: Normalizes and prepares text for optimal NLP processing
- **CSV Storage**: Maintains a clean dataset of all CSE courses

### Step 2: NLP Processing (Text → Numbers)
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts course descriptions into high-dimensional vectors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
- **Semantic Understanding**: The system understands word relationships and context through n-gram analysis
- **Vector Storage**: Saves vectors for fast retrieval and comparison

### Step 3: Intelligent Search
- **Query Processing**: Converts user queries into the same vector space as course descriptions
- **Cosine Similarity**: Calculates the angle between query and course vectors to measure semantic similarity
- **Ranking**: Returns courses ordered by relevance score (1.0 = perfect match, 0.0 = completely unrelated)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the NLP recommender demo**:
   ```bash
   python3 nlp_course_recommender.py
   ```

4. **Start the web application**:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5001`

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Data Preparation
The system combines course code, title, and description into a single text representation:
```
"CSE 101: Computer Science Principles. Introduces central ideas of computing..."
```

### 2. Vector Generation
Each course description is converted to a high-dimensional vector using TF-IDF vectorization:
```
Course: "machine learning algorithms" → [0.23, 0.45, 0.67, ...]
Query: "AI and neural networks" → [0.25, 0.43, 0.65, ...]
```

### 3. Similarity Calculation
Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors:
```
similarity = cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
```

### 4. Ranking and Results
Courses are ranked by similarity score and displayed with relevance indicators.

## 💡 Example Queries

Try these example searches to see the system in action:

- **"machine learning and artificial intelligence"** → Finds CSE 337, CSE 353, CSE 354
- **"web development and user interface"** → Finds CSE 316, CSE 416, CSE 416
- **"ethics and social responsibility in technology"** → Finds CSE 300, CSE 301
- **"data structures and algorithms"** → Finds CSE 214, CSE 373, CSE 373
- **"computer networks and security"** → Finds CSE 310, CSE 408, CSE 409

## 🎯 Use Cases

### For Students
- **Course Planning**: Find courses that align with your career goals
- **Prerequisite Discovery**: Discover foundational courses for advanced topics
- **Interest Exploration**: Explore new areas of computer science
- **Schedule Optimization**: Find courses that complement your current studies

### For Advisors
- **Student Guidance**: Recommend relevant courses based on student interests
- **Curriculum Planning**: Understand course relationships and dependencies
- **Academic Counseling**: Help students make informed course choices

## 🔍 API Endpoints

The system provides a RESTful API for integration:

- `GET /api/status` - System status and model information
- `POST /api/search` - Search for courses by query
- `GET /api/course/<code>` - Get details for a specific course
- `GET /api/similar/<code>` - Find courses similar to a given course
- `GET /api/examples` - Get example search queries

## 🛠️ Technical Details

    results = recommender.search_courses(query, top_k=5)
```

### Custom Vectorization
Adjust TF-IDF parameters for specific use cases:
```python
# Modify vectorizer parameters in generate_vectors() method
self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=2000,  # Increase features for more detail
    ngram_range=(1, 3),  # Use trigrams for better context
    min_df=1,  # Include rare terms
    max_df=0.9  # Exclude very common terms
)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn'"**
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

**"Vector generation failed"**
- Check if course data is properly loaded
- Verify CSV file format and content

**"No courses found"**
- Verify `cse_courses_simple.csv` exists
- Check file permissions and format

**"Web app won't start"**
- Ensure Flask is installed: `pip install flask flask-cors`
- Check port 5000 isn't in use
