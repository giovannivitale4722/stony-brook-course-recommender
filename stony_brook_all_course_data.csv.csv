AAS 332 - Japanese Literature in the Meiji Era,3 credits,"This course examines Japanese literature of the Meiji era, an era unique in the history of the world. Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location.

During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo’s criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel. Due to Japan’s literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well.",,,https://catalog.stonybrook.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=7&coid=4881

"CDS 101 - Energy, Climate, and Society",3 credits,"The energy consumption of 21st century societies is causing the Earth’s climate to warm at an alarming rate, threatening terrestrial life as we know it; this impasse scientists sometimes call a “wicked problem.” What is the history of energy consumption that has brought us to this point? How did we become aware - culturally and scientifically - of the crisis? What are the cascading impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services? How can we imagine moving through the impasse and emerging on the other side? What are the political opportunities and blockages? How can we change our societies to be less energy intensive and more adaptable to the warming already baked into the climate system? What kinds of engineered solutions - carbon sequestering and clean energy, for example - are here or on the horizon? This class will explore these issues from several transdisciplinary perspectives, from climate science to chemistry to urban planning to literature and film.",,,https://catalog.stonybrook.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=7&coid=5546

"HIS 307 - Silk Roads and Spice Routes: Travel, Exploration and Discovery in the Premodern World",3 credits,"How globalized was the world before the modern period? What connected famous explorers like Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Christopher Columbus to people who traveled the globe as part of their daily lives as merchants, diplomats, and sailors? Travel was a central feature of the medieval world and one of the primary factors that contributed to cultural contact, communication, exchange, and the diffusion of ideas between Europe, Africa and Asia in the pre-modern era.

At war with indigenous peoples in its empire for almost the entire century, and faced with restive and even revolutionary laborers, Irish Home Rulers and suffragettes on the domestic front, Victorians formulated imaginary solutions to the real social and political problems faced at home and in the colonies, and these formulations of monsters, social or supernatural impacted nothing less than western conceptions of modernity itself. National and imperial developments across hemispheric and transoceanic space provide the larger contexts for the two assigned novels (about monsters) and historical narratives and primary sources (about Victorian society). Finally, the course also teaches historians how to use literary fiction as historical sources (a methodology distinct from but linked to that of literature departments), in conjunction with primary and secondary historical works.",,,https://catalog.stonybrook.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=7&coid=6691

In particular, we will attend to the impact of decolonization on issues of race, class and gender within British domestic culture. Britain entered the 20th century as the world’s premier imperial power, the barometer of global technological, cultural, political and intellectual developments. As the empire disintegrated, wracked by world wars and nationalist revolts, the British state took up a different kind of revolution – a ‘socialist’ revolution–that sought to give its citizens economic and social security ‘from the cradle to the grave.’ At the same time, British society was significantly enlivened, and further transformed, by the influx of immigrants from former colonies and the Commonwealth. The second half of the twentieth century thus marked the successes and failures of the twinned projects of socialism and decolonization, while also producing new kinds of mass cultural exports that continue to shape global culture. These narratives of changing configurations of empire, class, race, gender and politics are the subject of our course, and will be explored through imaginative and historical literature and film.",,,https://catalog.stonybrook.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=7&coid=6692
